# React + TypeScript + Vite

#NPM Modules Used


#Application Stats 


#Difficulty faced while optimizing
.Use SVG icons wherever possible as they are lighter than image type icons.
.Initially was using facker.js module due to which module load time was increasing significantly optimized it from 86 % to 96 %

#Hurdels
code was breaking when resultTable was not able to show data where the body has multiple components each with unique ids 

#Working and reason for use
-use react context+ useReducer as application is small and better to use it compared to redux

#default queries
